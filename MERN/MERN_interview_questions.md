### üìå **What is Reconciliation in React?**

**Reconciliation** is the process by which React updates the **DOM** efficiently. When the state or props of a component change, React doesn‚Äôt re-render the entire DOM. Instead, it updates only the  **changed parts** , minimizing performance hits. This process is also called **"diffing"** ‚Äî React compares the new virtual DOM with the previous one and applies the minimum number of changes to the real DOM.

### üîπ **How Does Reconciliation Work?**

1. **Virtual DOM** : React creates a lightweight in-memory representation of the real DOM called the  **Virtual DOM** .
2. **Diffing Algorithm** : React compares the current virtual DOM with the previous one. It finds the differences and only updates the parts that changed.
3. **Update the Real DOM** : After determining the minimal set of changes, React updates the real DOM.

### üîπ **Example:**

```jsx
function Counter() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    return (
        <div>
            <p>Count: {count}</p>
            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
        </div>
    );
}
```

* When the button is clicked, the state `count` changes.
* React creates a new Virtual DOM and compares it with the old one.
* Only the **`<p>Count: {count}</p>`** element will be updated in the real DOM, not the entire `<div>`.

### üî• **Key Points:**

* **Efficiency** : Only changes are applied to the real DOM.
* **Virtual DOM** is the key to making this process fast.
* **React‚Äôs Diffing Algorithm** helps avoid unnecessary DOM manipulations.

This process makes React very efficient, especially in complex applications with many components. üí°

### üìå **What is Replication in MongoDB?**

**Replication** in MongoDB refers to the process of **duplicating data across multiple servers** to ensure high availability and data redundancy. With replication, MongoDB creates copies of data on  **multiple servers** , called  **replica sets** , which helps ensure that data is always available even in the case of server failure.

A **replica set** consists of:

* **Primary** : The main node that handles all write operations.
* **Secondary** : Copies of the primary node that replicate the data. These nodes can serve read requests (depending on the configuration).
* **Arbiter** (optional): A node that doesn‚Äôt store data but helps in elections to determine which primary node should be active in case of failure.

### üîπ **How Replication Works in MongoDB:**

1. **Primary Node** : Only the primary node can accept write operations.
2. **Secondary Nodes** : Secondary nodes replicate data from the primary node, ensuring that they are always synchronized.
3. **Automatic Failover** : If the primary node goes down, one of the secondary nodes is automatically promoted to primary, ensuring continued operation without human intervention.
4. **Read & Write Operations** : Reads can be performed on any node (primary or secondary) based on the configuration, but writes can only occur on the primary.

### üîπ **Example of Replica Set:**

Suppose you have a MongoDB setup with three nodes: `Primary`, `Secondary 1`, and `Secondary 2`.

1. **Primary Node** handles all writes, e.g., inserting a document:
   ```js
   db.users.insert({ name: "John", age: 30 });
   ```
2. **Secondary Nodes** replicate the document from the primary:
   * After the write, both secondary nodes receive the update and store an exact copy of the data.
3. **Automatic Failover** : If the primary node goes down:

* One of the secondary nodes is automatically promoted to primary.
* The system continues to function, ensuring high availability.

### üî•  **Key Points About Replication** :

* **Data Redundancy** : Multiple copies of data on different nodes ensure no data loss in case of failures.
* **High Availability** : Automatic failover means your application can continue running even if the primary node goes down.
* **Read Scaling** : Secondary nodes can handle read queries to distribute the load.

### **What is CORS? (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**

**CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)** is a security feature in web browsers that **restricts** how resources (like APIs) can be accessed from a different domain. It prevents **unauthorized access** to resources from unknown origins.

üëâ **Problem:** By default, browsers **block** requests from a different domain for security reasons.

üëâ **Solution:** CORS **allows** controlled access to resources from different origins using headers.

---

### **Why is CORS Needed?**

1. **Security:** Prevents unauthorized websites from making requests to your server.
2. **Allows API Access:** If you have a frontend on `http://localhost:3000` and a backend on `http://localhost:5000`, CORS enables communication between them.
3. **Prevents Malicious Requests:** Stops harmful scripts from accessing sensitive user data from other domains.

---

### **Example Without CORS (Blocked Request)**

If a frontend hosted on `http://localhost:3000` tries to call an API from a backend at `http://localhost:5000`, it will **fail** due to CORS policy:

```javascript
fetch("http://localhost:5000/api/data")
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error("CORS error:", error));
```

üí• **Error in Console:**

```
Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:5000/api/data' from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy.
```

---

### **How to Enable CORS in Express.js**

To allow CORS in an  **Express.js backend** , use the `cors` package:

#### **1. Install CORS Package:**

```bash
npm install cors
```

#### **2. Enable CORS in Express.js:**

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const cors = require("cors");

const app = express();

app.use(cors()); // Enable CORS for all requests

app.get("/api/data", (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: "CORS is enabled!" });
});

app.listen(5000, () => {
  console.log("Server running on port 5000");
});
```

Now, your frontend (`http://localhost:3000`) can successfully fetch data from the backend (`http://localhost:5000`).

---

### **Custom CORS Configuration (Restrict Access)**

You can allow only **specific domains** instead of enabling CORS for all.

```javascript
app.use(
  cors({
    origin: "http://localhost:3000", // Allow only this frontend
    methods: "GET,POST", // Allow only specific HTTP methods
    allowedHeaders: ["Content-Type"], // Allow only specific headers
  })
);
```

---

### **Summary:**

‚úî **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)** allows controlled access to resources from different domains.

‚úî Needed when **frontend (React)** and **backend (Express)** run on different origins.

‚úî Prevents **security risks** but can be configured to allow safe access.

‚úî Use `cors` middleware in **Express.js** to enable CORS and control which domains can access the API.

### **What is a Preflight Request in CORS?**

A **preflight request** is an **OPTIONS request** sent by the browser **before** making an actual API request when:

1. The request method is **not** a simple request (GET, POST, HEAD).
2. It includes **custom headers** or uses `PUT`, `DELETE`, `PATCH`.

üîπ **Purpose:** To check if the server allows the actual request before sending it.

---

### **How Preflight Works?**

1. The browser sends an **OPTIONS request** to the server.
2. The server responds with CORS headers (`Access-Control-Allow-*`).
3. If allowed, the browser sends the actual request.

---

### **Example of Preflight Request**

#### **Frontend (Client) Request:**

```javascript
fetch("http://localhost:5000/api/data", {
  method: "DELETE",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer token123" // Custom header triggers preflight
  }
})
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error("Error:", error));
```

üí° Since the request uses **DELETE** and a custom header (`Authorization`), the browser first sends an **OPTIONS** request.

---

### **Backend Response to Handle Preflight**

Add CORS headers in  **Express.js** :

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const cors = require("cors");

const app = express();

// Enable CORS with preflight
app.use(cors({
  origin: "http://localhost:3000",
  methods: "GET, POST, DELETE, OPTIONS",
  allowedHeaders: ["Content-Type", "Authorization"]
}));

// Handle preflight requests
app.options("*", (req, res) => {
  res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "http://localhost:3000");
  res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Methods", "GET, POST, DELETE");
  res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Content-Type, Authorization");
  res.sendStatus(204); // No content
});

app.delete("/api/data", (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: "Data deleted successfully" });
});

app.listen(5000, () => {
  console.log("Server running on port 5000");
});
```

---

### **What is `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`?**

It is a **CORS response header** that tells the browser **which domains are allowed** to access the resource.

üîπ **Example Response Header:**

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:3000
```

‚úÖ **Allows requests only from** `http://localhost:3000`

‚ùå **Blocks requests from** `http://example.com`

---

### **CORS Headers and Their Roles**

| Header                               | Purpose                                               |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`      | Specifies which domain can access the resource.       |
| `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`     | Lists allowed HTTP methods (GET, POST, DELETE, etc.). |
| `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`     | Specifies allowed headers (e.g.,`Authorization`).   |
| `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` | Allows credentials (cookies, tokens) to be sent.      |

---

### **Summary**

‚úî **Preflight request** is an **OPTIONS request** sent before actual API requests when using custom headers or non-simple methods.

‚úî `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` **controls which domains** can access the API.

‚úî Use **CORS middleware** in Express to handle preflight requests properly.

‚úî Preflight ensures **security** by confirming server permissions before making real requests.
